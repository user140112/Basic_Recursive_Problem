In this program, we have three distinct assignment operation namely (n1=10),(n2=20),(result=n1+n2)
and one arithematic operation (n1+n2).So, our total operation is 4.If we change our input values 
such as (n1=50) and (n2=300).Then our total operation still remain 4.So, the number of opertions 
don't depend on input value.We can say that the time complexity of our program is O(1) that means constant time.
